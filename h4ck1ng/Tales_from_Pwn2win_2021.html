<body><h1>Tales from Pwn2win 2021: Dots Exposed and Ruthless Monster writeups</h1>
<p>1623898709</p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>On the twenty-eight of May occured the Pwn2Win 2021, THE BEST (gnx did not matter at all to that success), BIGGEST AND MOST DISORGANIZED CTF OF SOUTH AMERICA. I made two challenges for it and I'm going to tell a little about how they were made, writeups, unintended solutions and a new version of the tool from last post for handling Unix Domain Sockets.</p>
<h2>Dots Exposed</h2>
<p>Challenge's source code : https://github.com/epicleet/write-ups/tree/master/2021/Pwn2Win/misc-Dots_Exposed</p>
<p>The first challenge was a Misc challenge about an Esolang called <a href="https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots">AsciiDots</a>, I fucking love Esolangs. The objective was to read <code>/flag</code> via an AsciiDots program.</p>
<p>I actually began working on that challenge a year ago and made a warmup challenge for Pwn2Win 2020 that achieved <strong>partial</strong> file read <strong>only if</strong> you were able to write to that file, like an PHP session file or a <code>access_log</code>. If you're curious: https://gist.github.com/caioluders/42a11b544aa34d812e68856707c8879d . A few weeks prior to Pwn2Win I tried to get arbitrary file read again, and it was incredibly fast to achieve that lol -- like two hours -- turns out that getting a year break from a task really helps (:</p>
<h3>Writeup</h3>
<p>AsciiDots is a language inspired by ASCII Art and works by having it's <code>dots</code> travel through the paths, somehow like eletronic circuits ( I know the physics don't work that way, don't hate me plz ). I'm not going to fully dive on how the language works, but will focus on the vulnerability. </p>
<p>Okay, the only way to read files is via <code>Libraries</code>, the ideia it's that you can import other <code>dots</code> programs to use on your main program. The first bug occurs here https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots/blob/6d5bb842cdfaea7e03e38ca31ce49e4910798c4e/dots/world.py#L178</p>
<pre><code class="python">178         path = os.path.join(dir_path, filename)
</code></pre>

<p>We can control the <code>filename</code> variable via the <a href="https://ajanse.me/asciidots/language/#libraries">lib import</a> <code>%!filename</code>, and it's possible to use an absolute path to import <strong>any</strong> file, <code>%!/etc/passwd</code> for example. This will end up in a list called <code>char_obj_array</code> which has all the characters of the main program and libraries. Let's see an example:</p>
<pre><code>%!/etc/hostname a

.a
</code></pre>

<p>The lists <code>char_obj_array</code>/<code>map</code> will end up like this after the parsing:</p>
<pre><code>%!/etc/hostname a

.a

h0stn4m3
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[['%', '!', '/', 'e', 't', 'c', '/', 'h', 'o', 's', 't', 'n', 'a', 'm', 'e', ' ', 'a'], [], ['.', 'a'], []]
[['h', '0', 's', 't', 'n', '4', 'm', '3'], []]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the empty lists after <code>.a</code>? This occurs because the interpreter will <code>.split('\n')</code> the source code, this way we can't make an ASCII path to access the imported file's characters and print them, because there is a newline between the library and the original main program :c</p>
<p>The second bug is that the interpreter expects that the main program file will end with an <code>\n</code>, this is sometimes true because some code editors will append a <code>\n</code> to the end of the file, Vim for example. This is a clear example of how a simple assumption about the user input can cause disastrous outcomes. If our program doesn't end with newline we can make a path to the library's characters. With these two bugs we can print all the characters of a library, column by column, and achieve arbitrary file read. </p>
<p>Final payload:</p>
<pre><code>%!/flag a

a

..................................................
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>
<p><code>CTF-BR{gosh,I_hate_those_fucking_0x0a}</code></p>
<p>Fucking <code>\n</code> ...</p>
<h2>Ruthless Monster</h2>
<p>Challenge's source code : https://github.com/epicleet/write-ups/tree/master/2021/Pwn2Win/web-Ruthless_Monster </p>
<p>My other challenge was in the Web category, and it's fully based on mine <a href="https://lude.rs/h4ck1ng/rootless_sniffing.html">Rootless Sniffing</a> blog post, so go read it plz (~<em>-</em>)~</p>
<p>I used a docker image from <a href="https://privatebin.info/">PrivateBin</a>, <code>PrivateBin is a minimalist, open source online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data</code>. The bin content is cryptographed client-side on the browser of the user, so having an RCE on the server was not enough to actually pwn the application and read the bin's content ( the flag was there, duh ).</p>
<p>The first part was an RCE using the <a href="https://devcraft.io/2021/05/04/exiftool-arbitrary-code-execution-cve-2021-22204.html">CVE-2021-22204</a>. Nothing new here, the challenge only accepted PDFs tho, just read his blog post.</p>
