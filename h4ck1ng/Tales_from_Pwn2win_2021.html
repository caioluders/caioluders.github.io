<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>On the twenty-eight of May occured the Pwn2Win 2021, THE BEST BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT CTF OF SOUTH AMERICA ( gnx did not matter at all to that success ). I made two challenges for it and I'm going to tell a little about how it was made, writeups, unintended solutions and how I improve the tool from last post for handling Unix Domain Sockets.</p>
<h2>Dots Exposed</h2>
<p>The first challenge was a Misc challenge about an Esolang called <a href="https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots">AsciiDots</a>, I fucking love Esolangs. It was a Arbitrary File Read 0day through importing Libraries and the objective was to read <code>/flag</code> via an AsciiDots program.</p>
<p>I actually began working on the challenge a year ago and made a warmup challenge for Pwn2Win 2020 that achieved partial file read, only if you was able to write to that file, like an PHP session file or a <code>access_log</code>. A few weeks prior to Pwn2Win I tried to get file read again, and it was incredibly fast to achieve that, turns out that getting a year break of a task really helps (:</p>
